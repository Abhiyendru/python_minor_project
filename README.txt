CCMS is a cyber cafe management system project which is based on python mysql connectivity.

Software Requirement:
1. Mysql
2. Python3 interpreter
3. Mysql python connector

At First the CCMS table.py file will be executed for one time only which will create the required tables and databases in the 
my sql server.
After that you can use the Main project file which contains all the operations it can do.
I have added a little synopsis or the flowchart of the program as well.
